# Installing the App Installer

The App Installer ships as part of Windows. It allows for easy installation of MSIX files and MSIXBundles.

If updates are enabled on a PC, then the App Installer will be updated automatically from the Microsoft Store. If the App Installer doesn't update, then you can use the troubleshooting tips at [Fix problems with apps from the Microsoft Store](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/fix-problems-with-apps-from-microsoft-store-93ed0bcf-9c12-3df6-6dda-92ec5d0415ac).

If your PC doesn't have access to the Microsoft Store, then use the download button below
