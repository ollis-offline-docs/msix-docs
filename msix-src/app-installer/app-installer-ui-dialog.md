* Version
* Source
* Capabilities
* Internet warning notification
* Install and Cancel buttons
* Launch when ready

## Application name
The application name is provided by the app author, and extracted from the [MSIX file.](/windows/msix/overview)

## Microsoft Store signature
If the dialog shows the string, "Microsoft Store App", you know the application has been successfully built and distributed through the Microsoft Store. Microsoft Store Signed Apps have been tested and comply with the [Microsoft Store Policies](/windows/apps/publish/store-policies)

## Publisher name and Version
The publisher name and version are provided by the app author, and extracted from the [MSIX file.](/windows/msix/overview)

## Source

The source provides the domain of the URL that the package was sourced from. This allows the user to decide whether they trust the source when deciding whether to install the package.

## Capabilities
The listing of the [capabilities](/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations) allows the user to evaluate what the application can access on your PC before installing it. If the application is accessing a capability you do not agree with, it is recommended you choose cancel.

## Install and Cancel buttons

The Install and Cancel buttons will generally be provided when installing applications. If you are downgrading an application or reinstalling the application, the text of the Install button will change to Reinstall.

The Cancel button closes the dialog without making any changes.

## Launch when ready

Because the App Installer improves the installation process, it can automatically start the app following installation. This is a check box control the user can uncheck.

## Internet Warning

App Installer will display an internet application warning for applications that come from the internet. This warning informs the user to use caution when installing this application. As with any application installed from the internet, the user must use caution. Only install apps from trusted sources, such as Microsoft Store, and be thoughtful about which apps you install.
