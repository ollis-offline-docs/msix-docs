# Accelerators

An accelerator provides an efficient way to convert legacy applications (apps) to MSIX format. It consists of important info regarding: the package (the app); the operating system (OS) on which conversion happens; and the steps required to fix the package for proper functioning of the converted MSIX.

## Prerequisites

To try out accelerators in a early-access preview build, join the [MSIX Packaging Tool Insider Program](/windows/msix/packaging-tool/insider-program).

## Create an accelerator 

To see the accelerator structure, and to use it to build your own accelerator, see the sample accelerators at the [MSIX-Labs](https://github.com/microsoft/MSIX-Labs/tree/master/DeveloperLabs/SampleAccelerators) GitHub repo.

## Definitions

- _PackageName_: Package is an application or program (Win32, WPF, or Windows Forms app) having a legacy (exe, msi, etc.) installer that's being converted to MSIX format.
- _PackageVersion_: Package versions are associated with a specific release. In some cases, you'll see a perfectly formed [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) number; and in other cases you might see something different. These might be date-driven, or they might have other characters with some package-specific meaning.
-  _PublisherName_: Name of the *original* publisher of the package.
- _EligibleForConversion_: Some apps are prohibited from conversion for security reasons, use of drivers, etc. Hence, this flag is used to determine the eligibility for conversion. Accepted values can be found [here](#accepted-values-for-eligibleforconversion).
- _ConversionStatus_: Determine status of application conversion. Accepted values can be found [here](#accepted-values-for-conversionstatus).
- _RemediationApproach_: 
  - _SequenceNumber_: Determines the sequence number of a fix-step. Fix steps to successfully convert the app need to be provided sequentially.
  - _Issue_:
    - _Description_: Text description of the actual issue encountered while conversion. For example, Registry errors or FileCreate errors in Procmon.
    - _Reference_:  (Optional Field) link to the document containing detailed information about the issue.
  - _Fix_:
    - _FixType_: The specific kind of step. Example - If FixType is “Capability”, a specific capability needs to be added at this point. Accepted values can be found [here](#accepted-values-for-fixtype).
    - _Reference_: Reference link to the document containing detailed information about the fix and how it needs to be done. This field is optional.
    - _FixDetails_: To determine specific kind of fix required under a particular FixType. Example - If Fixtype is “Dependency”, then FixDetails would have a array-type field called "Dependencies" to list down all the dependencies that need to be added for the application. Use cases can be found [here](#use-cases-for-fixdetails).
- _MinimumPSFVersion_: (Required only when atleast one of the FixType uses PSF or [PackageSupportFramework](/windows/msix/psf/package-support-framework-overview)). Since PSF releases are backward-compatible, any version greater than this specified version will work.
- _AdditionalComments_: To list additional information regarding app conversion, solely meant for human reading. This field is optional.
- _Edition_: Edition of the Operating system. Example - Windows 10 Enterprise.
- _MinimumOSVersion_:	Version of the Operating system. Example - 21H1. This field is to signify that any version greater than this specified OS version will work.
- _MinimumOSBuild_: Build Version of the Operating System. Example - "19043.1165". This field is to signify that that any OS build greater than this specified OS build will work.
- _Architecture_: Architecture of the package (application). (32/64 bit)
- _MSIXConversionToolVersion_:	Version of MSIX Packaging Tool used for conversion. Example - 1.2021.709.0;
- _AcceleratorVersion_: Version of the accelerator being used. Currently the latest version is 1.0.0.  
  
## Command line option for Accelerators

For auto-conversion, you can generate the accelerator template through MSIX Packaging tool.

1. Ensure that 'Generate a command line file with each package’ option is selected in MSIX Packing Tool Settings.

1. Convert an app using the MSIX Packaging tool, applying an accelerator in the conversion process.

1. By default, the conversion template file will be saved in the same location as your MSIX package, unless you specify a different save location.

1. Run the MsixPackagingTool.exe in elevated mode.

1. Run the following cmdlet to use the accelerator template:

```yaml
MsixPackagingTool.exe create-package --template c:\users\documents\AcceleratorTemplate.xml

```

### Relation between EligibleForConversion and ConversionStatus

| EligibleForConversion        | ConversionStatus |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Yes                          | Successful - No Fix Required, Successful - Fix Required, Converted With Issues |

### Accepted values for FixType

| Accepted values | Definitions |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Capability* | Capabilities needed (eg: allowElevation, uiAccess etc.) for MSIX application to work. To be added in AppManifest or via Capabilities page in MSIX packaging tool during conversion. See [here](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-capabilities) for more details. |
| Dependency | Dependencies needed (eg: C++ 2008 Redistributable x86) for MSIX application to work. To be downloaded externally in the OS environment. |
| InstallationPath | Used to custom set the exe/msi installer location in case it installs data outside default folder (Program Files). Path needs to be added in "Package Information" page in MSIX packaging tool during conversion. See [here](/windows/msix/packaging-tool/create-app-package#:~:text=Install%20location%3A,application%20install%20operation.) for more details.|
| Custom | Fixes that need to be done manually by the user to fix the MSIX application. Eg: Changing Application Id sequence in the app manifest. |
| PSF* | Adding Package support framework fixups (Eg: FileRedirectionFixup) to fix the MSIX application. User need to create a config.json and add it and other necessary dlls in the package during conversion. See [here](/windows/msix/psf/package-support-framework-overview) for more details. The author of the accelerator needs to provide the yaml equivalent of config.json in PSFConfig field. |
| Services | Services that needed to be included/excluded in order for the MSIX application to work. Need to specify in the Service Report of MSIX Packaging tool during conversion. See [here](/windows/msix/packaging-tool/convert-an-installer-with-services) for more details. |
| EntryPoint | To fix issues related to EntryPoint (Eg: ShortcutNotCaptured). See [here](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-application#:~:text=Default%20value-,EntryPoint,No,-Executable) for more details. |
| InstalledLocationVirtualization* | It is an extension that redirects any writes to the app's installation directory to a location in the app data. See [here](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-uap10-installedlocationvirtualization) and [here](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-uap10-updateactions) for more details. The default values for ModifiedItems, DeletedItems and AddedItems are keep, reset and keep respectively. |
| LoaderSearchPathOverride* | It is an extension that allows an app developer to declare a path in the app package, relative to the app package root path, to be included in the loader search path for the app's processes. The author of the accelerator needs to provide a the list of paths to be included. See [here](/uwp/schemas/appxpackage/uapmanifestschema/element-uap6-loadersearchpathoverride) for more details. |
