# Deploy MSIX Core with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager
MSIX Core enables an enterprise to standardize on the MSIX packaging format for their applications. IT Pros can easily deploy the MSIX Core installer to their devices and enables: install, query, and removal of packaged apps (that already work on those Windows versions).

MSIX Core provides a subset of features of native MSIX, functioning similar to existing Win32 installer types. MSIX Core does not provide the container benefits of native MSIX, nor enable an app that uses Windows 10 specific features to work on early Windows versions.

## Get started
The following steps will guide you through setting up an MSIX Core deployment strategy by using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager:

1. Deploy MSIX Core with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager
1. [Update your existing MSIX package to support MSIX Core](support-msix-core.md)
1. [Deploy MSIX Core Apps with Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](deploy-msix-core-app-with-configmgr.md)

> [!Note]
> Optionally, after following this guide, you may elect to push the installation of the MSIX Core application on to all required devices within your environment prior to installing any MSIX Core enlightened apps.
